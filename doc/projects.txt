lxdops project handling:

Config.Project:
    specifies the project that the container will be launched at.
    if empty, use the lxc current project

--project
    overrides Config.Project


containers:
If an lxdops (container) name contains "_", then it is assumed to fully specify the project and the container as {project}_{container}.
If the project is thus specified, lxdops adds a --project flag to "lxc", and/or a --target-project flac to "lxc copy".

devices:
When creating devices, the container name in the device pattern will be the normalized fully qualified container name, i.e. {container} for the "default" project and {project}_{container} for any other project.

profiles:
lxdops does not use a --project qualification for profiles.  Profiles are created and/or used in the current project.
If you launch x.yaml in the default project, then switch projects and launch x.yaml in the new project, lxdops will use the same x.devices profile for both containers.
