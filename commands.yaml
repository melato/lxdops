short: manage LXD containers together with attached ZFS disk devices
long: |
  lxdops launches LXD containers and creates or clones ZFS filesystem devices for them.
  lxdops launches an "instance" by:
    - Creating or cloning a set of ZFS filesystems
    - Creating and initializing a set of sub-directories under these filesystems
    - Creating an LXD profile with disk devices for these directories
    - Launching or copying an LXD container with this profile
    
  lxdops can also install packages, create users, setup .ssh/authorized_keys for users,
  push files from the host to the container, attach profiles, and run scripts.
  
  One of its goals is to separate the container OS files from user files,
  so that the container can be upgraded by swapping its OS with a new one,
  instead of upgrading the OS in place.
  Such rebuilding  can be done by copying a template container
  whie keeping the existing container disk devices.
  
  The template container can be upgraded manually, using the OS upgrade procedure,
  or relaunched from scratch.
  
  A Yaml configuration file provides the recipe for how the container should be created.
  It can include other config files, so that common configuration
  can be reused across instances.
  
  Devices are attached to the container via an instance profile.

    long: |
      Rebuild stops, deletes, and relaunches the container.
      It preserves the previous hwaddr from the container,
      so the new container should have the same IP addresses as before.
