description: |
  creates a clone of container c1, in a separate "test" zfs filesystem tree.
  The clone is like c1 (include c1.yaml),
  except that it uses the "test" section property (include/test.yaml).
  Its devices are zfs clones of the @test snapshots of the devices of c1 (c1@test)
  But the snapshots are found in section "", specified in the source-config file (c1.yaml)
  
  Note that this does not clone the c1 container.
  It clones its devices but creates the rest of the container the same way as c1 is created.
  If you wanted to also clone snapshot "x" of the container, you need to add origin: c1/x
